Following is how documents are stored in database.


# Holes Collection
All the neccessary information about a hole is stored here.

From a hole document, you can go further find its comments, the others holes which are citing this hole, author profile etc. in other collections.

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "545efe76a98d930012da6d4b"
  },
  "publish_time": "Tue May 31 17:46:55 +0800 2011",
  "text": "Hello Treehole! :smile:",
  "images": [
    {"$pid": "1123hopafsd092asd3"}
  ],
  "author": {
    "$uid": 109823742
  },
  "feedbacks": [
    {"$fid": "0987zvij12321sa"},
    {"$fid": "apoi123209z8ah2"},
    {"$fid": "a9x7jj1gh2kjsj0"}
  ],
  "references": [
    {"$hid": "545efe74a98d930013da8c02"},
    {"$hid": "545efe74a98d930013da8c03"},

# Comments Collection
Each comment is a document which is stored out of its hole document - here in a collection.

However, to determine whether to show an anonymous user or real name, one should check the `option`. If the display should be anonymous, then go and find according role based on `from_user.$uid` and `hole.$hid`.

``` json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "545f28a80000000000000000"
  },
  "post_time": "Sun Nov 09 17:56:55 +0800 2014",
  "text": "This is a simple comment",
  "hole": {
    "$hid": 545efe76a98d930012da6d4b
  },
  "from_user": {
    "$uid": 2147483648
  },
  "reply_to": {
    "$cid": "545e28a80000000000000000"
  },
  "options": {
    "anonymous": true,
    "secret": false
  }
}
```

| Field       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
